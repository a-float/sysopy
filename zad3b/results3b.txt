Zgodnie z oczekiwaniami, im wiekszy poziom optymalizacji, tym mniejszy czas spedzony w trybie uzytkownika
Najwiekszy roznica jest pomiedzy brakiem optymalizacj (-O0) a jej zastosowaniem (-O1/2/3).
Poziom optymalizacji nie mial wplywu na czas operacji IO
Roznice w czasie pomiedzy poziomami -O1, -O2 i -O3 sa niewielkie.
